# Data Structures & Algorithms Notebook

---

A roadmap to learn data structures and algorithms. As I go along I keep on adding the resources I used to learn about
various data structures and algorithms. I have tried to include the resources that are free, mainly university
lectures.

## How to prepare

**_THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT._**

Start doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structures and algorithms. You need to apply what
you're learning to solve problems, or you'll forget. You're not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the
knowledge.

Once you've learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for example, Linked Lists:

- Open coding problems website or ask Chat-GPT for few problems
- Do 2 or 3 questions regarding Linked Lists.
- Move on to the next learning topic.
- Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems.
- Do this with each new topic you learn.
- Keep doing problems while you're learning all this stuff, not after.

## Best time to learn

I'm a software engineer and want to learn Data Structures for my next interview. I get distracted a lot by other topics
of interest, for example, Reactive Kafka etc. But I managed to overcome this by following these two simple rules:

- Focus only on single topic and see it to completion
- Wake up early (like 5 AM) and study. (No noises, fresh mind)

For those who are not working professionals, learn about a topic for like 20 minutes and take a break of 10 minutes.
After doing above I used to go to job. Form these good habits and all the best in your pursuit.
